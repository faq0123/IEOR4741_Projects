# Video Demo Script - HFT Trading System
## Phase 4 Project Demonstration

**Duration**: 5-8 minutes
**Objective**: Demonstrate system functionality and performance

---

##  Scene 1: Introduction (30 seconds)

### Visual
- Show project folder structure
- Display README.md

### Script
> "Hello! This is my Phase 4 project for IEOR E4741 - a High-Frequency Trading System implemented in C++17. 
> 
> This system demonstrates advanced C++ concepts including templates, smart pointers, memory pools, cache alignment, and RAII patterns.
>
> The system achieves sub-microsecond median latency and handles over 465,000 ticks per second."

### Commands
```bash
cd phrase4
ls -la
tree -L 2  # or: find . -type d -maxdepth 2
```

---

##  Scene 2: Code Overview (60 seconds)

### Visual
- Open key header files in VS Code/editor
- Highlight advanced features

### Script - Part 1: Templates
> "Let's look at the core data structures. The Order struct is fully templated with compile-time type checking."

### Show `include/Order.hpp`
```cpp
template <typename PriceType, typename OrderIdType>
struct Order {
    static_assert(std::is_integral<OrderIdType>::value, 
                  "Order ID must be an integer");
    // ... fields
};
```

### Script - Part 2: Memory Pool
> "The OrderBook uses a custom memory pool allocator to reduce allocation overhead by 70-80%."

### Show `include/OrderBook.hpp`
```cpp
template<typename T>
class MemoryPool {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<T[]>> blocks;
    // ... fast allocation
};
```

### Script - Part 3: Cache Alignment
> "Market data is cache-line aligned for optimal CPU cache utilization."

### Show `include/MarketData.hpp`
```cpp
struct alignas(64) MarketData {
    // 64-byte alignment
};
```

---

##  Scene 3: Building the Project (30 seconds)

### Visual
- Terminal showing build process
- Successful compilation

### Script
> "The project uses CMake for cross-platform builds with aggressive optimization flags."

### Commands
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Show build output
make -j8
```

### Expected Output
```
[100%] Built target hft_app
[100%] Built target test_latency
```

---

##  Scene 4: Running Main Simulation (90 seconds)

### Visual
- Run main program
- Highlight latency statistics

### Script
> "Let's run the main simulation which tests three scenarios: basic, aggressive matching, and a stress test with 100,000 ticks."

### Commands
```bash
cd ..
./bin/hft_app
```

### Narration Points
1. **Basic Simulation (10K ticks)**
   > "Notice the median latency of around 850 nanoseconds - that's less than 1 microsecond."

2. **Trade Summary**
   > "The system executed over 8,000 trades matching buy and sell orders."

3. **Stress Test (100K ticks)**
   > "Under sustained load, we maintain throughput of 465,000 ticks per second with P99 latency under 6 microseconds."

### Highlight
- Point to: Min, Mean, P50, P99 latency
- Point to: Throughput calculation
- Point to: Total trades executed

---

##  Scene 5: Latency Benchmark Suite (90 seconds)

### Visual
- Run benchmark program
- Show detailed statistics

### Script
> "Now let's run the comprehensive latency benchmark suite which tests the system under various load conditions."

### Commands
```bash
./bin/test_latency
```

### Narration Points

1. **Basic Latency Test**
   > "The basic test shows P99 latency of 3.8 microseconds."

2. **High-Load Test**
   > "Even with 1,000 pre-populated orders in the book, P99 stays under 8 microseconds."

3. **Load Scaling**
   > "Watch how latency scales as we go from 100 to 50,000 orders - it's logarithmic, as expected from our multimap data structure."

4. **Comparative Analysis**
   > "This shows how order book depth affects performance."

---

##  Scene 6: Examining Trade Logs (45 seconds)

### Visual
- Show generated log files
- Display CSV content

### Script
> "The system generates detailed CSV logs of all executed trades with nanosecond-precision timestamps."

### Commands
```bash
ls -lh *.log

# Show first 20 lines
head -20 trades_basic.log

# Show total trades
wc -l trades_stress.log
```

### Expected Output
```
Timestamp,BuyOrderID,SellOrderID,Symbol,Price,Quantity
86192038740934,3,2,AAPL,150.17,120
...
```

---

##  Scene 7: Code Deep Dive - Smart Pointers (60 seconds)

### Visual
- Show main.cpp order creation and matching

### Script
> "Let's look at how we use smart pointers for automatic memory management."

### Show `src/main.cpp`
```cpp
// Create order with unique_ptr
auto order = order_manager.createOrder("AAPL", price, quantity, is_buy);

// Transfer ownership with move semantics
auto trades = matching_engine.matchOrder(std::move(order));

// No manual delete needed - RAII handles cleanup
```

### Script
> "Notice we never call 'new' or 'delete' - everything is handled by smart pointers. This provides 100% memory safety with minimal overhead."

---

##  Scene 8: Performance Analysis (60 seconds)

### Visual
- Open PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md
- Highlight key metrics

### Script
> "The system achieves latencies competitive with commercial HFT systems from the early 2020s."

### Show Table
```
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mean Latency | 0.98-2.3 μs |
| P99 Latency | 3.8-7.4 μs |
| Throughput | 465K/sec |
```

### Script - Part 2
> "Cache-line alignment improved latency by 15-20%, and the memory pool allocator is 70-80% faster than standard allocation."

### Show Experiments
```
With alignas(64):    P99 = 3.9 μs
Without alignment:   P99 = 4.8 μs
Improvement: 19%
```

---

##  Scene 9: Architecture Overview (45 seconds)

### Visual
- Show ARCHITECTURE.md diagrams
- Scroll through component descriptions

### Script
> "The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns."

### Show Flow
```
MarketDataFeed → OrderManager → OrderBook → MatchingEngine → TradeLogger
```

### Script
> "Each component has a single responsibility:
> - MarketDataFeed simulates market ticks
> - OrderManager tracks order lifecycle
> - OrderBook maintains buy/sell orders
> - MatchingEngine executes price-time priority matching
> - TradeLogger writes trades to disk using RAII for safe file handling"

---

### Script
> "This project demonstrates several advanced C++ features:"

### List with Code Examples

   ```cpp
   static_assert(std::is_integral<OrderIdType>::value, ...);
   ```

2. **Smart Pointers**
   ```cpp
   std::unique_ptr<Order>  // Exclusive ownership
   std::shared_ptr<OrderInfo>  // Shared ownership
   ```

3. **RAII**
   ```cpp
   ~TradeLogger() { flush(); }  // Automatic cleanup
   ```

4. **Cache Alignment**
   ```cpp
   alignas(64) MarketData { ... }
   ```
